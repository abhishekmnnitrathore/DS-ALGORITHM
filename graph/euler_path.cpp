/*
 * Euler Cycle: Traverse each edge once only
 *to complete cycle in graph.
 *
 * Difference between Euler Cycle and Hamilton cycle:
 * Euler is for edge and hamilton is for node.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1-> graph should be strongly connected
 * 2-> graph in and out degree should be same for all the nodes.
